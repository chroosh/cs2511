what does it mean by "an enemy is touching a player" - please define touch
(if the next move from an enemy is going to touch the character then the player dies)

should be able to die when you touch an enemy is a bit of an ambiguous goal

story points <<--- (important)

need support for composite goals within your individual goals

eg if there is a level where the goal is to reach the exit and not worry
about the treasure. Have a headsup display//progress bar, a list of goals

when you implement specific things like swords - you need to define how much
durability it has
- the same goes for potions

how do you communicate to the user that which key is for which door
(different coloured keys and different coloured doors)

either an entire inventory system, or you can switch swords when you pick it
up and drop it off

move character around can just be part of gameplay, and not part of ui

x by y matrix the sizeof the map and each grid slot has a list of items on it
to be rendered
